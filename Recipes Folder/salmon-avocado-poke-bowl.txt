Salmon & Avocado Poke Bowl
Poke (pronounced poh-kay), the bite-size marinated fish salad famous in Hawaii, is so popular that it's sold by the
pound in supermarkets. Now it has crossed the Pacific to become the meal-in-a-bowl du jour, served in eateries
from Los Angeles to New York. But it's easy to make at home with this quick recipe. Sriracha and Chinese-style
mustard add a touch of heat to the classic poke seasoning of soy sauce and sesame oil. Serving it over a brown rice
salad makes it a meal.
