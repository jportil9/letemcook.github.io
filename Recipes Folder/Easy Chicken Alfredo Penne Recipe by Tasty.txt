Preparation
1

Melt the butter in a large pan over medium-high heat, then add the chicken breasts. Seaso
with the salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Cook 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is fully
cooked. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

2

Make the sauce: In the same pan over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the garlic.
Cook until the garlic begins to soften. Stir in half of the flour at a time until incorporated.
Gradually pour in the milk, stirring between additions, and cook until fully incorporated and
the sauce begins to thicken. Season with the salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Add the
Parmesan cheese and stir until melted.

3

In a large bowl, pour the sauce over cooked penne pasta, then add the chicken and toss
well to combine. Add the parsley and Parmesan and toss again.
