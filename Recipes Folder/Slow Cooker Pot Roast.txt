The Best Ever Slow Cooker Pot Roast
This slow cooker pot roast only takes six ingredients to make thanks to a packet of onion soup mix. It
gives the roast a ton of flavor without a ton of work, and no one will even know it’s there. The best
part? You just dump everything into the slow cooker, walk away for a few hours, and dinner practically
cooks itself. Serve it over egg noodles or rice and dinner is good to go.
