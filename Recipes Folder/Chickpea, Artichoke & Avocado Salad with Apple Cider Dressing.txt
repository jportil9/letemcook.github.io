Chickpea, Artichoke & Avocado Salad with Apple Cider Dressing
This delicious 400-calorie salad is a helpful tool for weight loss because it provides a good balance of fiber, protein
and healthy fats from loads of veggies and beans, all tossed in a tangy apple-cider vinaigrette. To meal-prep these
for lunch throughout the week, pack the dressing and the salad separately and make sure your veggies are
thoroughly dried before packing them together.
