Ingredients
2 cups (276g) diced baby red potato
3 cups (298g) trimmed and halved green beans
1 large head of broccoli (2 cups; 137g)
1 and 1/2 cups (161g) chopped bell peppers (2 large or 6-7 mini sweet bell peppers)
13 ounces (368g) smoked sausage (See Note 1)
6 tablespoons (73g) olive oil
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional (leave out if you don't like heat!)
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon EACH: dried oregano, dried parsley
Salt & pepper
Serve with: fresh parsley, quinoa/rice, lots of freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Instructions
1. PREP: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a very large sheet pan (I use this 15x21 inch sheet pan) or 2
smaller pans with parchment paper and set aside.
2. PREP VEGGIES: It is important to prep the veggies according to directions to ensure they all cook at the
same rate. Wash and chop the unpeeled baby red potatoes. You want the pieces quite small. I halve the
baby potatoes and then dice each half. This yields a total of 10-12 pieces per potato. Trim the green beans
and then cut in half, chop the broccoli into florets, chop the peppers into 1-inch pieces, and coin the
sausage in thick (1/2-inch) slices.
3. OLIVE OIL AND SEASONINGS: Place all the veggies and sausage on the prepared sheet pan. Pour the olive
oil and all the seasonings on top. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4

teaspoon pepper to start with). Use your hands to toss and evenly coat all the veggies and sausage with
seasonings. Space everything out so it has plenty of space to cook. If veggies are crammed/overlapping
they'll steam instead of roast and will take longer to cook.
4. BAKE: Bake 15 minutes, remove from the oven and flip/stir all the veggies around. Return to the oven and
bake for another 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender.
5. ENJOY: If desired, sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the veggies and sausage as soon as they
come out of the oven. (If you aren't adding the cheese, you'll likely need to add some more salt to the dish.)
Add fresh parsley if desired and enjoy immediately. Serve over cooked rice or quinoa if desired.
6. STORAGE: I don't recommend freezing this recipe; the veggies end up mushy upon being thawed. Leftovers
will stay great in airtight containers in the fridge for 3-4 days. Obviously, there is a loss of texture, but overall
it's still delicious!

Notes
Note 1: Turkey, chicken, or beef smoked sausage all work great; we typically use hardwood smoked turkey
sausage.
