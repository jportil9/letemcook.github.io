15 Minute Lo Mein! Made with just soy sauce, sesame oil, a pinch of sugar,ramen noodles or spaghetti noodles, and any veggies or protein you like. SO YUMMY!

INGREDIENTS
Sauce:
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce (sub regular soy sauce if needed) (Affiliate link)
1 tablespoon light soy sauce (sub regular soy sauce if needed) (Affiliate link)
3 tablespoons oyster sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1 clove of garlic, grated (optional)
Lo Mein:
4–6 ounces uncooked ramen noodles (Affiliate link)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
3 green onions, chopped (separate green parts from white parts – you’ll use both separately)
2–3 cups julienne cut or chopped vegetables like carrots, red peppers, cabbage, bok choy, mushrooms, or broccoli
1–2 tablespoons mirin

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Sauce: Shake all the sauce ingredients together in a jar.
2. Noodles: Cook the noodles according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
3. Lo Mein: Heat the sesame oil in a large wok or skillet. Add the green onions (white parts) andvegetables to the hot pan. Stir fry until fork-tender, about 5 minutes. Add the mirin to loosen the browned bits up off the bottom of the pan. Add the cooked noodles and about half of the sauce – toss around in the hot pan to combine. Add more sauce if needed (I usually gauge the amount of sauce I want by the color of the noodles – you want a medium brown color, not too light, not too dark). Serve topped with remaining green onions!

NOTES
If you want to add a protein, stir fry it first, before the vegetables, then remove from heat while you cook the vegetables. Add back into the pan at the end with the noodles.
