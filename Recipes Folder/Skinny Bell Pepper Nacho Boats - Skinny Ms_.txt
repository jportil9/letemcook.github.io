Ingredients
3 bell peppers
1 pound lean ground turkey
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
3/4 cup salsa no sugar added
1 cup cheddar cheese reduced-fat, grated

Instructions
1. Remove seeds, core, and membrane from bell peppers then slice each one into 6 vertical
pieces where they dip down. Set sliced bell peppers aside.
2. Cook ground turkey over medium-high heat, breaking up as it cooks. Cook until the turkey
loses it's pink color and is cooked through. Drain off any fat.
3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
4. Combine cooked turkey with spices and salsa. Evenly distribute mixture into the bell pepper
boats, top with cheese.
5. Bake on a parchment lined baking sheet for 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and peppers
are hot. Optional ingredients: sliced Jalapeno peppers, diced avocado, fat-free Greek yogurt
or sour cream, or sliced green onions.
6. NOTE: If you prefer much softer bell peppers, add a few tablespoons water to the bottom of a
large casserole dish, add filled nachos, cover tightly with foil and bake 15 minutes.

Notes
This recipe makes 18 nacho boats.
