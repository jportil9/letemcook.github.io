Ingredients
Vegetables
1 sweet potato (about 1 lb.) $1.51
12 oz. frozen broccoli florets $1.19
2 Tbsp olive oil $0.26
1/2 tsp seasoning salt* $0.05
salt and pepper to taste $0.05
BBQ Meatloaf
1/2 lb. ground beef $2.50
1 large egg $0.26
2 Tbsp bread crumbs $0.12
3 Tbsp BBQ sauce, divided $0.26
1/4 tsp smoked paprika $0.03
1/8 tsp garlic powder $0.02
1/4 tsp salt $0.02

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Peel the sweet potato and cut it into 1/2 to 3/4" cubes. Place the
sweet potatoes and frozen broccoli florets (no need to thaw) on a large baking sheet.
2. Drizzle the olive oil over the sweet potatoes and broccoli florets. Sprinkle the seasoning salt
over the sweet potatoes and then season the broccoli florets with a pinch of salt and pepper.
Use your hands to toss the vegetables until they are coated in oil and spices, keeping the
sweet potatoes on one side of the baking sheet and the broccoli on the other.
3. Transfer the baking sheet to the preheated oven and roast the vegetables for 15 minutes.
4. While the vegetables are roasting, prepare the meatloaves. In a medium bowl combine the
ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, 1 Tbsp of the BBQ sauce, the smoked paprika, garlic
powder, and salt. Work the ingredients together with your hands or a fork until they are well
combined. Divide the meatloaf mixture in two and shape each half into a flattened oval.
5. After the vegetables have roasted for 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet and stir each of
the vegetables. Push each off to the side a bit to make room for the meatloaves. Place the
shaped meatloaves in the center and then spread 1 Tbsp of BBQ sauce over each loaf.

6. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast for an additional 20 minutes, or until the
internal temperature of the meatloaves has reached 160ºF. Remove the baking sheet from
the oven, plate up the meatloaves and vegetables, and serve immediately.

Notes
I used a seasoning blend called Avec Tous, but you could use any seasoning blend you like (Tony
Chachere's, Lawry's, etc.).
