Ingredients

2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts
1 cup BBQ sauce
1/4 cup Italian dressing
1/4 cup brown sugar
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
salt to taste

Instructions
1

Season chicken breast lightly ( a small pinch per breast) with some sea salt and place
in your crockpot.

2

In a mixing bowl combine BBQ sauce, Italian dressing, brown sugar and
Worcestershire sauce. Stir until well combined.

3

Pour over chicken, cover and cook on HIGH for 3-4 hours

4

Once time is up, you can serve the breast whole, or shred with 2 forks. If shredding,
recover and let cook in sauce for about 10-15 more minutes to soak up all that delish
flavor.

5

Serve on buns, over rice, in wraps, on a salad or eat a plateful as is! Our favorite way
is on fresh rolls, topped with coleslaw.
