Lemon-Basil Pasta
Protein-packed cannellini beans, lemon zest, and heady fresh basil fill this made-in-minutes pasta dish with fresh
summer flavors. To store extra basil, snip a quarter-inch from its stems, stand it in a glass filled with about an inch of
water, cover loosely with a plastic bag, and refrigerate.
